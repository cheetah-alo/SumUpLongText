# Motivations 

The main motivations for this practice in NLP are to applied technics learned and explore new ones.  I selected this dataset as I have been related to situations working for companies where lots of information without classification is saved in data warehouse, and no classification is defined. It will be nice to apply systems to help procress such as find a specific theme in thousands of papers, and summarizing those. 



# Process Applied



The process I follow was: 



1. Loading datasets
2. Cleaning and Pre-Procesing
3. Data Exploration and Exploring some hyphotesis 
4. Models
   1. K-Means Classification
   2. LSTM Text Summarizing
5. Running the model on the data
